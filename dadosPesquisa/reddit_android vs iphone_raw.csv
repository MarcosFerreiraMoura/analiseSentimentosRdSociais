1;Android vs iphone
2;Because of a brand name mainly. Pretty much any other argument is either false or a result of comparing 100$ android phone to top iPhone model and then being surprised 100$ phone is not as good... For businesses, apparently iPhones have good hardware security that pretty much only Pixels can match. Also many people are locked in the ecosystem and getting out is annoying/costly.
3;"Most of my friends and family use Android; newer tech, AI, better cameras, bigger batteries, faster charging. iPhones haven't changed much over the years."
4;People are stupid.
5;Because cult.
6;It used to be that iPhone had the absolute best SoC. When iPhone 5s was released, Android ain't even on 64 bit. So I think a lot of people switched at that time. Then simply never came back. I did with 6s. Another issue Android had was carrier software updates. Sometimes you get really really bad software support due to your carrier, iPhone didn't have this problem. That being said both of these issues don't exist anymore, people should try Android :) honestly my Fold 7 feels faster than my iPhone 16 Pro Max (benchmark also confirms this). While being vastly more interesting to use.
7;Some people are impressed by brands. Some are not.
8;I use a Pixel 8 Pro and an iPhone 16 Pro Max regularly. I prefer my iPhone when I’m on the go and I prefer my Pixel when I’m sitting on the couch watching TV or whatever. Personal preference, I like both, I think both platforms are acceptable but my opinion is somewhat nuanced.
9;iPhone vs Android or iOS vs Android. Two different comparisons.
10;Polished apps, updates released to all compatible devices worldwide at the same time, reliable Face ID and many years software support just to name a few.
11;Trust me but no body after 2 or 3 years will advise you with an android phone while my iphone 11 still works fine with latest update and has a very satisfying resell value till now also my s20 ultra no one want to buy it anymore this device released after the iPhone 11
12;iPhone user since 2014, Should I switch to Android? Need help deciding
13;Iphone is boring. I get it. And you can buy the latest android flagship, fine. But in my daily experience with both phones, i find the iphone really generally smoother in usage. The software is optimised. That is the little edge that i can see. They said its because the app developers built their apps with the iphone in their mind.
14;iPhone user since 2009 here (that also use Android). I would say it's the best time right now to switch to Android! iOS is right now the worst it has ever been. Riddled with several year old bugs that never gets fixed. And performance issues, even on the 16 Pro models. Android is way more polished than iOS right now! So go for it!
15;Ive used Chinese phones before, I use Iphone now, and will probably switch to an android in the next 3 years. But the android I will only consider after the experience is Google and Samsung lol.
16;I think you should go for an android get the S25U.
17;I love android and I think android has much better phones. BUT iPhone just feels better for me and I always end up going back anytime I switch to android.
18;I think you should give a try to Z Flip or Fold. S25 Ultra is great and I have one, I was same as you and once switched def not missing anything.
19;For the Flip, see if these things are appealing to you
20;It's all pretty much the same nowadays. I use both. Using android is not a problem for me because imessage is not our defacto messaging app.
21;If you're getting a chinese android like a Xiaomi phone (they make some excellent models), you'll have to connect it to your PC and get rid of their junk apps and ads with ADB.
22;"Iphone 17 series will be same as 16 series like 16 was same as 15 series. Just some ""new"" features. Iphone 17 base model will be more popular for gamers bc it got the 120hz screen. Just buy android. Iphone series has been litterally same since iphone 14"
23;After 18 years on iPhone, I’m finally giving Android a real shot — S25 Ultra vs Pixel 9 Pro XL vs OnePlus 13

25;"Pixel is the cleanest and most iPhone like experience, save for the fact there's no real Pixel ecosystem. Although Android in general is the ecosystem, despite each manufacturer having multiple devices and tiny little proprietary functions, in general Android is the ecosystem so you'll never get the full Apple experience. Samsung makes great phones and is a safe choice, but the amount of configurations can be daunting.. Or exciting. Their cameras are great but they do suffer a bit from ""shutter lag"" I'm currently on a OnePlus for the first time in almost a decade, and the 13 is an amazing phone with great tech. However the camera fluctuates between amazing and WTF. More amazing than wtf but still. And the OS is smooth but leaves a lot to be desired in terms of consistency and expected behaviour vs other Android manufacturers. You can't go wrong with any of them, but based on your priorities I'd pick in that order."
26;I like samsung because their software offers ways to customize / do anything you can imagine. Especially with Goodlock If that's something you'd like, the S25 Ultra is the perfect choice. But if that sounds overwhelming or something you wouldn't use, then go for the Pixel 9 Pro for its clean and simple software
27;At the least you should wait for the Pixel 10 announcement. Make your decision after the first round of reviews come out.
28;>*Airdrop (testing LocalSend)* I also recently moved after total iphone usage to android but still using macbook / imac / chromebooks. i've never really seen anyone mention this, but the easiest solution i found for moving bits of data between machines was to set up a dedicated folder pinned to the top of my whatsapp chats. since i use it on all my devices (desktops / laptops / mobiles) stuff gets moved around incredibly quickly and I find it's all i need. I did try stuff like pairdrop etc but honestly whatsapp is just faster since there's a lot of muscle memory there. you can see in this screenshot i whatsapped myself a link to an older version of the plex apk from my macbook earlier this morning, and it's there for me to to pick it up on my android when i want it later. But it could as easily be a photo, or a pdf, or whatever.
29;iPhone to Pixel seems a logical choice.
30;"Whoa, man. It's a phone veteran. You even had the first iPhone. Why did you upgrade every single year? I never understood you ""Always upgrade"" types. What do you do that for? I find phones perfectly fine for a couple of years after purchase. It's been that way for a long time too, at least since the S3. So, I'm just super curious, why do you upgrade every time?"
31;"As a Samsung user since 2018, I am 100% biased but still want to share my take. Yes, there are some software grievances to be had with Samsung devices but they are all solvable with a little time and effort. Should you have a bunch of apps preloaded that you have to uninstall/disable, as well notifications to disable? No, it's some crap. That said, after you do it that's it. What you're left with afterwards is a very customizable user experience. Between the native Samsung customization, the freedom of Android and Samsung's ""Good Lock"" App ( you can tweak your experience to however you like. I would take a Samsung over a OnePlus because of software support (Samsungs get monthly security patches and OS updates for 7 years) and that they don't use proprietary charging, so if you lose/break your charger and/or cable, you can just get technically any USB Power Delivery+Programmable Power Supply charger (that operates 9 Volts and ~3 Amps for 25 Watt Super Fast Charging 25 Watts or 10 Volts at ~4.5 Amps for Super Fast Charging 2.0 45 Watts) and have your fast charging without needing to buy 1st party chargers and cables. I love my 65 Watt Anker Optimus Prime Edition. Lastly, I wouldn't recommend a Pixel. They don't use the best hardware in any respect, be it the camera system, processors or charging speed. Pixels run hotter than Samsung's, perform worse on tasks and get shorter battery life. This isn't conjecture: you can find many tests online proving this. If the camera software is a concern, you CAN sideload the Pixel's camera software onto a Samsung, or use Samsung's ""camera assistant"" integration in their camera app to tweak your experience, like changing how sharpened images are, turning off shutter lag and maintaining settings upon each app relaunch, like reduced exposure compensation (I find between ""-0.1"" to ""-1"" for photos gets rid of the motion blur in most shots by shortening the auto exposure time and reduces highlight blowouts: you can always tweak photos for more brightness or less contrast in the Photos/Gallery app) Ultimately the choice is yours and I wish you the best of luck with your switch. If you don't like the more square nature of the S25 Ultra, you can always try the S25+ instead."
32;If you're not in a rush, the Pixel 10 will come out in a few weeks. This should put it up to par with the S25 release-wise.
33;"I've been daily driving Pixels almost exclusively since the 2 XL. I prefer the way the UI works compared to others, I like Googles ""put it out there and tweak it as you go"" method, and their willingness to maintain a support page with life cycles for nearly every piece of hardware they put out. Samsung has caught up on that last one for their phones, but Google was the only one doing it when I got on board."
34;CMV: android is better than iPhone in basically all aspects
35;/u/N9s8mping (OP) has awarded 6 delta(s) in this post. All comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/1ltxb77/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_android_is_better_than/), in /r/DeltaLog. Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended. ^[Delta System Explained]( ^| ^[Deltaboards](
36;I think the ecosystem is Apple’s strong suit- airdrop, AirTags, Apple Watch, continuity, sidecar
37;It’s not that iPhone is better, it’s just the UI feels better. Plus, it’s a better option for my dad, who is older, tech illiterate, and a bit of an idiot when it comes to falling for scams online, so the iPhone is a much better option for him. Also, the accessibility options are integrated much better into iPhones for people with disabilities, and this dates back to the early days of the 3GS or so. My mom is blind and is able to use an iPhone much easier than an Android. So for power users, or anyone wanting customization and freedom, Android is better. But for those that prefer the UI, have disabilities, or shouldn’t be allowed that much control over their phone (typically the elderly and children), Apple is much better.
38;“In basically all aspects” is you leaving yourself some wiggle room, so I’m not expecting to see deltas. I’ve used both Androids and iPhones over the years, but have stuck with iPhone lately. My friends and I had the same ideas long ago, “whoa on Android you can modify this thing, and you have control over that thing!” It sounded so cool, but then we just never did those things. Unless you are a serious tinkerer, all of that control means nothing. The iPhone works extremely well out of the box. The UI is generally better than Android. For me, my partner had an iPhone and sharing photos became a million times easier with AirDrop. I have so much going on in life that the idea of tinkering and customizing the functionality I want/need from a phone would be a negative for me now, the iPhone out of the box is good enough for what I do (calls, emails, photos, wallet, some browsing).
39;>In android you are the admin. Iphone leaves you as a user This is completely useless to a vast majority of phone users. Nobody is out there power-modding their daily driver devices. But on the other hand, it makes the phone immensely more vulnerable. >Android has the feature known as oem unlocking, which basically let's you change the os in a phone. Same as above. Useless for most of the user base, and a security threat to the same user base. >Faster charging and relatively similar battery lifes Faster charging isn't necessarily better. Li-ion batteries are quite susceptible to aging due to hyper-fast charging, and the thermal stress added by it. A lot of users tend to leave their phones plugged in. With fast charging, this means the phone shoots to 100% in no time, and then ends up trickle charging. Trickle charging really ruins Li-ion batteries. The 80% limitation was introduced very recently, and thanks to fragmentation, it's not available everywhere. [The best practice for Li-ion batteries is to top it off in small increments over the day.]( Super-fast charging is only useful when in an emergency scenario where charging time is going to be short, but usage will be long. Again, not a very day to day kinda scenario. >On iphone, you have to get the pro model just for 120 hz. On android, 90 hz is minimum and 120 hz is standard. True, but what if I told you that most average users don't notice this. I handed over my 120Hz display device to a colleague who has a 60Hz display. After about half an hour of usage, he didn't really feel much of a difference. He was comfortably back at 60. I personally can't do that. But a lot of people don't really care about it. I mean, it'd be good if all iPhones got a 120Hz display, but end of the day, it's a low priority feature for users. What iPhones do guarantee is: * 5-7 years of usage. Easily. I know so many people who are on the 6th-7th year of use and with near original performance. * Consistency in usage. The platform doesn't make huge changes, and **all new updates are available for every single device, simultaneously, globally**. This completely defeats the perpetual Android problem of deep fragmentation. This really hits hard. My dad has a pixel. My wife has a oneplus. So even if I wanted to tell my dad how to do something on his phone, the oneplus isn't necessarily gonna be an accurate reference because of the changes in software! This gets frustrating real fast. * Updates for older devices: All iPhones get 7 years of OS updates. Not just security ones. This is something Android is still catching up on. And most of those devices will work near full despite being several years old! And to give a reference to all this. I used Android devices for a decade. I used to regularly root, try out custom ROMs on my device, do all sorts of experiments. But now I am at a point where I need my phone to be consistent, and quick. I don't want any variations. I don't want fancy UIs or root access. I need it to be a good phone. And that's what iPhone gives me.
40;man the android vs iphone debate is so 2010’s. long as the phone can make calls video chat and has twitter instagram and reddit who cares.
41;Fundamentally the success of the iPhone is based on the simplicity of operation. While techies love tinkering and the joy of playing around with the hardware, most people are happy to sacrifice performance if it means they’re less likely to have issues. Apple have spent a lot of time on UI and importantly making setting up their devices a very simple exercise with very few clicks. So yes, Android phones are generally better performance wise and the control you have is fantastic - if you care to have that level of control. The iPhone’s success shows that most people don’t care for that level of control, and the “security” that not having that control entails.
42;I think your premise is pretty narrow from a user perspective. It sounds like you are a tech person, maybe an engineer who likes to personalize their devices because you know what you want. I’d argue that most cell phone users don’t know what they want, they want someone to choose for them. They want to text, make calls, use the web, play some games, and a good camera. There are numerous studies of iPhone v android by age group, young and old prefer iPhones. Genx seems to prefer android. So I’d say you are partially right based on your narrow premise but not based on the average consumer.
43;I'll add one niche reason: hearing aids. As a HA user, the iPhone's MFi protocol (which is now supported across a wide variety of modern hearing aids) allows for direct wireless connectivity to my hearing aids. Makes phone calls a breeze!
44;1. Even as a dev i dont really care about customizing my phone that much. iPhones and apple products as a whole are simple and work perfectly every time. Its consistent, reliable and simple 2. I used to have androids before switching to an iphone (for imessage group chats mostly) and something about the whole experience is just… crisper. Android has better specs sure but the haptics, the weight of the gestures, however i interact with it feels correctly tuned. My androids were “snappier” but in a way that made it feel cheap and none of the better specs actually contributed to a better experience. Any of the processors, screens and cameras we have today are overkill so that feel matters way more to me.
45;Android vs IOS
46;The universal back gesture is wonderful, and I didn't realize how much I use it until I used iOS for the first time.
47;"My GF had the same experience. She was terrified of switching to Android as she'd been using iOS since the advent of smartphones. She switched just before Christmas (OnePlus Nord 4 CE Lite) After a few days she was saying stuff like ""oh my god, we've been lied to"" regarding iOS being ""superior"" and wishes she'd switched years ago."
48;Because Apple did not give you a choice. Now, you are tasting a bit of freedom.
49;The last 4 versions of iOS lose to android on a 200$ budget android phones in terms of features and functionality.
50;Finally. You didn't just break away from a phone. You broke away from worlds biggest marketing firm.
51;I caught backlash from people in my iMessage group chat for switching to Android. Honestly, the only reason I'd ever use iOS is for iMessage, FaceTime, and just to fit in
52;So true, although I use two phones, my S25 Ultra is by far my favorite. Compared to my work issued iPhone 16 Pro Max, the Samsung wins. I've carried both iPhone and Android phones for years and find the S25 Ultra the very best. I do have several years experience with Pixel models, but overall the S25 Ultra is my favorite.
53;Glad you like it. Me, I’m pretty much os agnostic. I switch back and forth every few years. Currently on iPhone after a decade on Android. I find windows, macOS and Linux equally easy to use. But in all my years using various android phones from different manufacturers, I have never had one that lasts the entire day without recharging like my iPhone 16 does. If there is anything I despise is having to recharge my phone halfway through the day when I want to use it.
54;Android is so much more fun. I love being able to tweak everything to my liking.
55;Got robbed in Vegas 2 weeks ago while on a work trip. My p6 pro was on its way out for the last few months and the rest of my family had been trying to convince me to move to a iphone. Picked up a 16 pro max a week ago and it's been nothing but a pain in the ass. I know I'm just not used of it but the carplay integration in my 23' bmw is terrible. Carplay traffic is so inaccurate and doesn't show any useful information on the cockpit screen. If I use Google maps it gives me a better route but the cockpit screen doesn't show a route or anything. The lack of a back button has to be the one thing I can't get used of. I can swipe back on some apps but not all in iOS. I ordered a z fold 7 and can't wait for it to arrive tomorrow so I can get back to normal.
56;iPhone or Android — and why?
57;Android for sure. I just like being able to mess with my phone how i want
58;Android is not bound to a single manufacturer, and it's cheaper, also heaphone jack
59;Android (I knew Steve Jobs)
60;Android, im a pirate arrr
61;Android cuz I'm not talking for that iPhone propaganda
62;Linux once it gets better. Android for now because freedom. Freedom to do what I want with my device, whenever I want.
63;Android. I don't like overpriced shit. And I certainly don't like my data being held hostage in an ecosystem that's hard to get out of. I'd take the annoyance of trying to integrate different apps and hardware than join the cult. We already plateaued on smartphones. I even buy 2nd hand. There's barely any point being locked in to a single brand. Android having lots of options is great, just remove the bloatware.
64;Android. I don't like being nannied.
65;We should stop arguing about phones. IDC what phone you use.
66;All phones, doesn’t really matter (imo)
67;Why do you prefer iPhones over any recent Android phones?
68;The ecosystem as a whole is more refined and complete.
69;"I'm using 11 pro which will be 6yo in September. Still runs smooth and I plan to keep it as long as it'll be receiving new updates. My mother in law uses Iphone SE 1st generation - still runs fine for her needs (call, write, bank app). It's a 9yo device already - the Android equivalents from 2016 are useless bricks. Will be used as long as the apps she uses receive updates. My Wife uses 12 Mini and Mother 13 ... I don't need to maintain them, those phones just works. I think mostly that ;)"
70;Better app quality, Face ID, focus mode, same day update as flagships, smooth ui, better privacy, fast spotlight search.
71;Honestly, in my opinion the iOS is very minimalist with a lot of features for productivity so basically is perfectly for me you daily use
72;iPhone 13 mini user here. There are no modern Android phones that is this small and powerful at the same time. Plus, my work relies on using FaceTime and iMessage when there’s no signal around. Apple Watch also only works with iPhone only.
73;Camera, I like making videos and editing them and have only found iPhones to be the best (Pro models) whether it be good quality or ProRes RAW, I dont see any androids matching up to this. Yes ik samsung's S series is good but I tried it too, nothing feels like iPhones tho
74;I dislike Samsung, never had a good experience with them. OnePlus gone to shit Pixel was pretty expensive for what it offers. I decided to go with an iPhone for the first time back in 2023 and I haven't had much to complain. Keyboard is meh, but otherwise the phone has been a better experience than androids. Doesn't crash, doesn't lag, and siri with carplay is substantially better than android auto with google assistant, because it understands my native language, which google does not.
75;Privacy. Recent study found that Android tracks and gathers data to send back to Google at 20 times greater amount than iOS to Apple.
76;"Camera works. Seriously. I was in IT and to maintain fluency, I used to switch every 6mo or so back and forth between the latest flagship Android and iPhone. The thing that eventually drove me over to iPhones for good? The camera opened quickly and worked. There would be times with a less than 6 month old Pixel that I'd double tap the power button for camera... and it'd lag there 2 seconds before the camera app opened. Then it still wouldn't let me take a picture for another second or so. But since then? Ecosystem. My watch unlocks itself from the phone. My watch can unlock my laptop. I can use my phone remotely from my computer. My messages show up on my phone, watch, computer and iPad. Find my is amazing with my wife, and many many airtags. Etc. In general? It just works. Is iOS bug-free? No. Is macOS perfect? Hell no. But in general, it all ""just works"" and works together, and works well. Anyone who says the Apple ecosystem is perfect is delusional, but it's less broken FOR me than Androids. Also since they've added USB-C, the ability to customize the home screen more.... there is less and less ""oh but android can X"". Except for side load apps, and you know what? Years later, I haven't missed the feature because I have everything I need from the app store."
77;I switched to an iPhone from android recently. I definitely have my complaints about this or that part of an iPhone (the keyboard for example). But features are like pieces of a puzzle, and apple’s features just fit together and hide the seams. I don’t have to fiddle with my earphones or configure a new app to make it work. It just works. Also both ecosystems have ads these days. But I find that the iPhone ads are a lot less intrusive. I like the control I have over my notifications. Having used android phones for 10 years at this point, the android mentality seems to be “look how feature packed this is. Look at all this fancy shit I can do for two years now”. And yet those features have to be configured or set up or what not. They don’t “just work”. When I say “just work” I mean working with zero effort. I am not willing to invest even two extra seconds to set something up. Literally. Period. That’s a red line. I don’t care if my android phone can automagically make me breakfast someday in the future. If it takes me two extra seconds to setup, I will not use it. There are things I value doing with my limited time and tinkering with my phone isn’t one of them. The iPhone ecosystem, with all its flaws and recent snafus, is still leagues ahead of android on the “just works” metric.
78;In what ways is the iPhone better than Android?
79;I use both, love both for different reasons. Why Apple? IOS is more refined, more universal especially with apps, updates are always on time, it’s clean and simple Ecosystem which is why I can’t fully go back. I have an Apple Watch Ultra 2, AirPods Pro 2, IPad Pro & having all this just makes life easier Why Android Better value, more options(Google, Samsung, Oneplus & More), more customizations, WAY BETTER AI ( Gemini is great!), Better google integration & more versatile camera systems. It’s all personal preference!
80;"Having used both I'd say where both are amazing (I guess why they are both so popular) the difference for me is that android is like an Olympic sprinter, and Apple is like a world class ballet dancer... both are in peak physical form and have and abundance of power, but where android uses this to win a race (faster processor, more pixels, bigger camera... more more more), Apple uses the power on a smaller more graceful way (ram management, cohesion between devices, smoothness)... certainly not to an extent that it's a form vs function thing (android after all is not unpleasant to look at, and Apple definitely gets the job done after all!) Absolutely everyone's personal choice as to what they need, and what they prefer... I'm a techy person (I love gadgets and toys) so always loved android so I could get the latest stuff first (be it a 200mp camera, or a folding screen), but I've recently moved to Apple, and have been really appreciating that where it doesn't do anything ""crazy"" it does all of the important stuff so well, and in such a refined way!"
81;Edit: Apparently Samsung offers updates for seven years now, so my original comment is wrong, please disregard! Thanks for enlightening me u/RandomBloke2021 ————————————— One thing not mentioned yet is that apple continues releasing all updates to as many of their older phones as possible. That’s why you’ll hear paper still using their iPhone 7’s and 8’a today. I had a Samsung Galaxy S8 that I really liked, but Samsung stops supporting their phones with new security updates after two years, which is really shitty if you ask me. I don’t think ALL manufacturers of Android phones stop support that quickly, but the fact that any do really sucks. There’s nothing wrong with Android OS at all, IMO. There’s certain things I actually really miss about my S8! But I like my phone to be supported for as long as possible. If you do too, I think iPhone is the best you can get in that regard.
82;Apps tend to be developed better on IOS. The ecosystem works pretty good with all the Apple devices. In my opinion Samsung has been doing pretty good I would have switched if I didn’t already own all these products.
83;The software and ecosystem. iOS is extremely protective of privacy from apps and trackers. And the overall consistency in design.
84;If you compare a $200 android with a $1000 iphone the difference will be humongous in favor of the iPhone. If you compare iphone with Samsung S series or Pixel, android is better, there is no advantage for the iPhone, OS wise. It has some hardware advantages, battery life is better and I find that face id is easier to use than the fingerprint sensor.
85;Better is almost entirely subjective. I'm using an iPhone right now, but I've had several generations of Pixel. There are a lot of things about Pixel that I would personally call better. Call screening. Hold for Me. Circle to Search. Google Assistant. Now Playing. The keyboard. Live translation. The things that I would call better about the iPhone are fewer, but bigger. iMessage is incredible. iMessage. AirDrop. FaceTime. I use a MacBook, and the integration is excellent. If you wouldn't use much of that, it's hard to say it would be better. For me, it's probably 45% iPhone and 55% Pixel. I just like them better. But not by much.
86;It's easy to build a cheap Android. Apple could have but choose not to.
87;I was on Android from the HTC Magic up till the OnePlus 9 Pro, I then moved over to iPhone 12 with iOS 15. So this is my thoughts and experience. 1- One of Androids strengthens is also its biggest weakness, diversity and choice. Over years of using Android I liked the different devices, ideas and styles but in the end that fragmented system just ment I didn’t know if or when I would get updates, they started to prioritise security updates but it was still hit and miss as and when you get them. This diversity also lead to devices and experience not always being smooth and focused. iPhones (as long as in support) all get the updates at the exact same time, and while there can be bugs Apple maintain a standard of devices so barring any hardware failures (Battery wear is a good example) the experience is always consistent. 2-Battery Life, Screen on time, iPhone may edge out certain devices but in the whole they are usually very similar. But Android manufacturers do tend to use bigger batteries, but with often less efficient hardware. The one area I have found iPhone to be better is standby time, my current 14 Pro is ready for a new battery but it definitely lasted longer than my OnePlus 9 Pro in standard by. 3- Ecosystem, I got a MacBook a few months before the iPhone, then the 6th Gen mini a few after and finally an Apple Watch. I’ve since expanded further with HomePod and AirPods. The ecosystem is excellent, devices working together to help me get stuff done, top down it’s just my favourite part. It has its moments but what’s nice is a quick restart and your back up and running. 4- Repairs, this is a double edged controversial sword. I like Apples repair system, I don’t like the price, I don’t support the full locking of parts but here’s what made me move to iPhone. I got the OnePlus 9 Pro from new, £900 ish of flagship Android phone, loved the hardware and stock Android with minimal tweaks. After 31 days the screen failed. I got it via OnePlus direct (Mistake) so I contacted them, the phone had to go off for repair they would just swap it as I was over the 30 days. I took extensive photos as the phone was perfect, not a single mark. ( I’m very OCD with the tech, it cost a lot I rely on it for work so I look after it) The repair to over three weeks, they had to wait for the screen, and they broke the bottom daughter board. When I got the phone back by this point I just had a feeling, so I filmed the unboxing. The phone was a complete mess, I’ve never been so upset, I’d taken excellent care of it and this repair centre had completely ruined it. The new screen had deep scratches in it, feel with fingernails deep, all three cameras had marks and dirt in them, one would no longer focus, the sides where marked and the back was not even stuck on correctly. I work in IT and did device repairs at the time so I had a good idea of what horrendous treatment this had been through to cause this damage. (Had i got it via Amazon maybe I would still be on Android as they would have just swapped it.) I contacted them a demanded a replacement, they kept telling me it would need another repair, I was getting desperate Phone wise, as I had just started my own business and the backup phone I had was fine for the first couple of weeks but longer was not an option. Back and forth, complaint after complaint. They finally replaced it. (After I bought another phone, and 4 plus months of messages) The whole experience just made me hate the phone, in the end I sold it and having done and not liked Samsung, and found Pixels to be hit and miss I just needed a phone that worked and if it didn’t I could go to a store and get it sorted. So I got my iPhone 12, then 14 Pro, yes Apples way of locking down repairs is not great but you can either get Apple Care (which I do) or there are at least third party options that while they may break some functionality and give an error message for a few days, will work and get you up and running. Getting parts for Android devices can be so it a miss. I’ve definitely missed so bits out, I know this is already a wall of text but I do try and look at it objectively has I had some great times on Android with some fantastic devices, but there where quite a few misses. iPhone wise my 12 was awesome and even though my 14 Pro is definitely ready for a new battery, and I’ve had my frustrations, (keyboard and the odd update bug) It’s been a brilliant device. Hope that helps.
88;I was definitely an iPhone guy all the way a couple of years ago. But Android keeps getting better and more refined while iOS in my opinion has become worse with the last couple of iterations. Buggier, more inconsistent. Apple Intelligence is a disaster. Airdrop sometimes manages to send stuff between devices, but sometimes it doesn’t. The control center is really bad. That said though, it’s obviously not a complete disaster, plus there’s a huge overhaul rumored for iOS that I’m really excited about. That could change everything. But as it is right now, using One UI 7 on my S25 feels more intuitive than using iOS 18.4 on my 15 Pro and I don’t think there are that many advantages at the moment.
89;Redditors that have owned both iPhone and Android, which one do you prefer and why?
90;I prefer whichever one I'm used to at the moment. They're both fine systems.
91;Iphone is more refined. But I'm not paying 5x as much, it's not even close to being worth it.
92;"5 years ago i wouldve said android hands down. But i recently upgraded to an S24 Ultra and its like theyve gone out of their way to make the shittiest phone possible. The auto correct is unbearable now. Ill type something, it will correct it (usually the correction is wrong), ill backspace to fix it, go to type the next word and it fucking corrects it again. And it does that like 3-4 times before it figures out i dont want it corrected. My next biggest gripe is the camera. On paper, the camera in my phone is better in every measurable way than the one in my last. But it has all this AI enhancement bullshit, so i take a photo and it looks okay (worse than my last phone but passable). Then i go to look at it and the AI kicks in and ""enhaces"" it and it looks like dogshit. And you cant turn it off, the best you can do is set it to ""minimal"" which looks even worse. The only way around it is to never open your photo in the photos app so the AI doesnt kick in. Not getting another Android Edit to add: most of the features thry advertise and that youd want to use requires a samsung account. In order to use a samsung account you have to give them permission to spy on basically everything you do on the phone"
93;iPhone
94;iPhone. I could be convinced to try a google pixel maybe, but Samsung is banned from the house
95;I switched from iPhones back when Samsung came out with the S7 Edge and I haven't gone back since, I love the Samsung phones. Apple's customer service was fucking awful, so bad I've never purchased another of their products for myself since then.
96;I've had them both on and off over the years. Primarily due to work giving me an iphone, and owning a samsung personally I prefer Android overall, lots of features, a lot more flexibility, a lot more choices in regards to the physical phone and ite qualities, for example I always get a phone with an SD card slot. IPhone has some great things about it though. Firstly the design is always great and so is the quality. Apps tend to run smoother generally and I find there's less bugs....HOWEVER when you do come across a bug, it's usually a pretty bad one. Your very locked in, no flexibility, no ability to really get into the guts of the OS. I also have very little respect to apple due to their money grabbing tactics and increasingly poor right to repair policies. I know samsung isn't perfect either, but damn apple really has gone too far for me to support them.
97;Samsung back button
98;iPhones are quicker
99;I tried Apple IPad for awhile and I absolutely hated it. I didnt like the 3rd party Reddit app. Everything feels so locked down. Crappy screen compared to android. Apps cost more. No fast charging. What really annoyed me the most is there is only 1 web browser. Apples WebKit. Safari, Chrome, Firefox. They all use apples WebKit. I used on Android Firefox and I have a working ad blocker, youtube sponsor block. Apple tax is real. Android is a much better product for less.

124;As someone with an android, who had the Morning Flower alarm sound for years when I worked at the asscrack of dawn, I can confidently say that when I woke up it was like dragging myself out of the grave to be killed for a second time.
125;I have to change my alarm every few months because they start to give me anxiety hearing them
126;I felt my soul leave my body the first time I woke up next to my wife, who uses the default iOS alarm sound.
127;I've developed a PTSD from that Samsung Galaxy S4 alarm because I had a roommate that would sleep through the alarm for hours
128;Waking up when its dark outside is definitely relatable
129;Early riser music on the sleep section of the clock app. So much more soothing
130;My co worker had gotten me a new job after I had worked at a god awful retail store for 3.5 years. She really wanted me to get that job because it’s where she would be working too and we loved working together. She put in a good word with the hiring manager. I didn’t drive so she drove me to all 3 interviews and they were across town. She drove me to the drug test place to get my drug test which was also like 35 minutes away. Drug place told me I had a “nervous bladder” because I had to piss all day long and as soon as I got there I didn’t have to pee. Literally took me like 2.5 more hours of sitting there and drinking water until I finally had to piss again. Co worker waited there the whole time with me. Co worker went through all that with me because she really wanted me to get that job with her. The hiring manager told me “if you miss the first training you’re fired” Guess what I did? Missed the first training. Why? Because my iPhone full volume, the alarm was so quiet it didn’t wake me up. I slept through it. Woke up to ten missed calls from co worker because she waited outside to take me to training with her. Woke up to two missed calls from the manager. I was so fucking mad. Lost that job because my alarm didn’t wake me up. I kind of expected it because my retail job was 3:30-11:30PM and the new job wanted me to start training at 4:30am. But I had pretty solid attendance at my retail job so it’s not like I was some lazy slacker or something who’s like eh I’ll wake up whenever. So now I use my ~~Nintendo DS~~ GPD XD — which is just a knock off DS with android loaded onto it — as an alarm clock. It’s like 50x louder. I also set it to make me answer a math question in order to turn it off. Never blowing an opportunity because of my alarm again.
131;Holy balls I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. I have an android and my husband has an iPhone and these are the EXACT same alarms that we each use. Whenever his alarm goes off it scares ever loving fuck out of me. It is seriously such an aggressive alarm! Haha. I've watched this 3x and I still have the giggles. This one's getting bookmarked for when I need a good laugh!

133;Marketshare of Android versions vs iOS versions [OC]
134;Data for Android from Data for iOS from created using infogram (
135;I bought a ZTE axon 7 mini when my LG Nexus 5x broke. It's a great phone, had all the features I was looking for in a phone, much nicer and newer technology than my old phone. What shits me though is that it's two versions of android behind my old phone. What the fuck is this? It's running v6.1 and that's the latest update for Australia Axon 7 minis, my old phone which was starting to feel dated was running v8.
136;Have a pixel, part of the 0.7%. I'm old so all I do is Reddit,text and email...and occasionally use the phone. I feel like after a certain point how much better can a phone get at those things?
137;"Manufacturers who use Android are intentionally forking the OS and slowing updates. They need to differentiate by touting the strong physical features of the phone. If they all use stock Android, they risk being a ""dumb pipe"" (e.g. Windows vs. IBM)"
138;This is both good and bad for Apple. I'm all for having the latest version *provided my device can handle it*. This is great if my device is still relatively new, but pushing these OS updates on older hardware is where the problems arise. I still remember when my iPad 2 was running smoothly only to have an OS update cause it to turn into a slow buggy mess! I was incredibly frustrated and it forced me to buy an iPad Air 2. My boss and a colleague had the same experience with their iOS devices. Given the choice I'd much rather be on the older version where the device runs smoothly than have the latest an OS has to offer. Unless the update maintains or improves performance, I'm of the opinion that once a device is two years old it should only receive security updates. Credit to Android here as their updates the past few years have been improving performance on older or less equipped hardware. Apple touting that almost all iOS devices are on the latest version is a con for anyone with a 2 year+ device. Doesn't help that it constantly pressures you to update.
139;Fragmentation on Android is still a problem. I know Google is working on it but it’s sad that carriers and handset manufacturers can both block an update.
140;Damn, I'm part of the only 0,7% of android users using the latest version. I'm surprised it's only such a small portion though.
141;Looks like I'm a 0.31% of iOS - still rocking iPod 4th Gen. They refuse to let me update it past 6.0
142;It would be interesting to see a distribution of the age of phone's. Most iPhone users I know upgrade at least every two years if not every year, while Android users tend to use phones for longer amounts of time
143;These comparisons are not all so valid at all this day and age. Android is constantly updating their core apps and services via playstore. Of course an OS update is a bigger change and brings tons of new under the hood improvements(for high end devices - usually) and sometimes features, though many of them are exclusive for the lastest flagship phones by Google. But for most folks, it's just a number(or a dessert) they are happy as long as the get the final versions of the apps they use and the phone still runs fast.

155;Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs IPhone 16 Pro Max [Specs Comparison]
156;If you ask the iPhone sub they will tell you the iPhone is better for various reasons , here obviously everyone is saying the Samsung. And no one is wrong. Both companies do things differently and that’s fine . People use phones differently. iPhone has simples features than Samsung which is charging for some. I personally like to switch between both. My previous phone was the Galaxy s10+ great phone for its time (still works my mum uses it) now I’m with Apple but will probably be moving on from my 13 pro max next year to whatever the Samsung s26+ is offering 🙂.
157;"Iphones being cheaper than Galaxy is probably only in the US. Pro Max is much more expensive here in Europe compared to the S25 Ultra. Also should've put ""fingerprint"" and ""face unlock"" since people forget that Samsung actually has both. You can still just use your face to unlock your phone. The 120hz on Iphones is also adaptive and it stutters way more often than on Samsung. In a lot of times it's actually stuck at 60hz, it's more like it goes to 120 rather than it being 120hz constant. Let alone you can easily use MaxHz on your Samsung and make it 120hz constant on ALL apps which is impossible on Iphones. You can also tune the animation speed in Samsung which can again make the phone feel more fluid and faster. Now with One UI7 we can tune the animations even more (with GoodLock) I'll give Apple props for their cameras though, since even if megapixels look dramatically less on paper, many of us know they actually have very good cameras and it's all about optimization. Not just megapixels. Overall, the S25 Ultra is a much better phone than the Iphone. The only things that Iphone has better as I said are probably the cameras and in my opinion the design. I like the Iphone design. Everything else is much, much worse. Let alone the iOS which is so much more basic than OneUI. People forget that you can't even download things in the background on Iphones. Multitasking is super weird and basic. The back gestures on Iphones are very unreliable too.and that has been a thing since the dawn of time. And so many other things that we take for granted in OneUI but they're still lacking in Ios"
158;The S25 Ultra has Qi2 25w wireless fast charging picture is incorrect.
159;I think the only thing missing here is facial recognition and the s-pen. Pretty good list otherwise.
160;I still don't understand why people are buying iPhones
161;You really can't compare phones like this... megapixel count doesn't tell you how good cameras are, battery capacity doesn't tell you how much battery life they get, amount of RAM doesn't tell you how fast each phone is, ...
162;"Calling 27W ""fast charging"" is crazy. 45W isn't even that good; most other phones have like 80W charging and 50W wireless charging (for half the price)."
163;Action button is underrated... Ik you can do the same thing with Registar, but they should've kept the bixby button and allowed remapping.
164;Calm down, children. They are both great phones. As a retired software/hardware design engineer, Android is better for me. I can make it do anything. My home screen contains three custom widgets designed and coded by myself. One of these provides detailed network information for 2g/3g/4g/5g and WiFi. A lot of people wouldn't be even slightly interested. As a former employee of a number of mobile phone infrastructure companies, I am. Those who just want a phone that works, may well prefer an IPhone. Just buy what you prefer.
165;Bro samsung's got face unlock as well

169;I still think s24 ultra is good vfm phone till 2030
170;These high-end phones are supposed to last you about 4 years or more if you take good care of them, so it's not that terrible of a deal. If one can get it from a country where it's at MSRP like in US or even Dubai, it's worth spending the money on an expensive phone. Considering we spend a lot of time on our phones for basically everything, including work, getting the best we can afford isn't a bad idea.
171;Titanium >>>>>> Aluminum Galaxy Ai >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> iShit Ai
172;I have a different take, you spend majority of your time with your phone, more than your family or work sometimes. So it does not hurt to spend some extra money to get the best..

183;Just to give a sense of how powerful apple A18 chips are its actually faster than macbook m1 air in CPU and matches the m1 in GPU. It even has the same ram as the base model m1 air thats some crazy performance packed in a phone
184;funny the one with much inferior processors are offering 7yr OS updates, I see mfs still rocking iphone X, 11 with smooth experience but I don't see anyone with Pixel 2 or S9 which speaks volume
185;Features wise the S24 and Pixel 9 is better but my heart says iPhone 16 just because of the processor. The Tensor and the Exynos is obviously inferior compared to the A18 chip. And 7 years of OS updates on Android? No way 😂. Let’s say even if it had that many years of updates, the performance degradation will be so bad with each update especially considering the chips that they are offering. iPhone is definitely the safe choice if long term usage is the goal.

196;It would have been a better map if it were by country instead of by continent.
197;In Finland its mostly countryside vs big cities thing. People in places like Helsinki are more common to have iPhone than in countryside. I've noticed similar thing in many other countries, in capital cities it is more common to see iPhones than in rural areas. In Finland its not even all about money & people in smaller cities making less money, its just that people have used Android all their life and most of their friends also use Android, so they think it is the best. In Helsinki people have more experience with iPhones and also have friends with iPhones, therefore they are not dissing iPhones for being overpriced status symbols due to lack of experience.
198;I feel like Android gives you more liberty to use whatever app you want, there is definitely a bigger selection outside the official store.

211;Holy smokes, both cameras did awesome for how insanely dark it is, I can not fathom how it captures so much light.

213;What these phones are doing is amazing. What the iphone is doing is amazing but I had no idea the Pixel 3 has been doing this already. Crazy that this tech has been around for almost a year already. Can't wait to see both improve over time
214;[removed]
215;And the Pixel 3a is only $399. Pixel 4 comes out next month. It is good to have competition.
216;The comparison seems to be subjective. The best way to test these is remove the label on top, make people guess and then show it at the end. This will be a fair comparison. The video context shows a bias :)
217;Does the phone need to be steady when taking a night mode pic? (I have not had a phone with a night mode before)
218;I'm a Google guy at heart, but DAMN the iPhone Pro/Max has REALLY upped the ante (can't wait until mine shows up Friday). Thank you Apple for for taking the time to work on the camera capturing/processing. Now fix that incoming call screen so it peeks in and you're closer to being golden.
219;Impressed that a £400 pixel compares well to £1000 iphone, hopes that the pixel 4 will surpass the quality of these
